Set the initial population, `N0`, as 100 and the growth rate, `r`, as 0.4\n","2.   Use the suitable `numpy` function to generate an array of time points, `t`, which go from 0 to 10 seconds, in 0.2 second increments.\n","3.

Create a new variable called `population_size_noise`, use the same expression you wrote in parts (3), and add noise to the population at each time point. Do this by adding an expression that uses a `numpy` function to generate a random value for each time point drawn from a normal distribution of `mean=0` and `stdev=250` (i.e., population_size_noise = expression_from_part_a + expression_to_add_noise)."]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":10,"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"executionInfo":{"elapsed":7,"status":"ok","timestamp":1668296875008,"user":{"displayName":"Kaylie Lau","userId":"01284785813595846851"},"user_tz":300},"id":"ULSswoS4EhRs","outputId":"6d541d46-0b4f-4300-9d52-bfd6d4877aff"},"outputs":[{"name":"stdout","output_type":"stream","text":["Population size:  \n"," [ 100.          108.32870677  117.3510871   127.12491503  137.71277643\n","  149.18246976  161.60744022  175.06725003  189.64808793  205.44332106\n","  222.55409285  241.08997064  261.16964734  282.92170144  306.48542033\n","  332.01169227  359.66397256  389.61933018  422.0695817   457.22251951\n","  495.30324244  536.55559711  581.24373944  629.6538261   682.09584693\n","  738.90560989  800.44689143  867.11376585  939.33312874 1017.56743061\n"," 1102.31763806 1194.12644178 1293.58173155 1401.32036077 1518.0322245\n"," 1644.46467711 1781.42731796 1929.79717555 2090.52432351 2264.63796432\n"," 2453.25301971 2657.57726999 2878.91908792 3118.69581683 3378.44284638\n"," 3659.82344437 3964.63940726 4294.84259788 4652.54744398 5040.04447781\n"," 5459.81500331]\n","Noise:  \n"," [ -83.9320499  -249.2977415  -313.78775145  249.69739045  -15.59013203\n"," -223.44242631  181.0210683    30.54017767 -230.54971948 -219.88122622\n"," -140.23140603  257.56157896  193.91876143   95.12576957 -405.17327608\n","  232.25781868  111.30894788   49.23654834  529.42776392  383.21313214\n","  662.44566992  405.63355764   78.17666627 -235.13645155 -470.61932697\n","  180.1337165  -277.66351013  147.6584902   -73.61040531   -8.73400909\n","  -25.10742649  187.7236904   417.14674126  117.49304189 -214.48035685\n","  325.13335102 -107.9091873    71.34192086 -122.16458465    3.89373157\n","  366.41285461  202.28993899  294.59250606  -14.51440342 -275.11673785\n","   96.83358578  -31.40828769  105.50806448   26.67895551 -187.02027359\n"," -189.85818872]\n","Population size with noise:  \n"," [  16.0679501  -140.96903473 -196.43666435  376.82230548  122.12264441\n","  -74.25995654  342.62850852  205.6074277   -40.90163155  -14.43790515\n","   82.32268682  498.6515496   455.08840877  378.047471    -98.68785575\n","  564.26951095  470.97292043  438.85587852  951.49734562  840.43565165\n"," 1157.74891236  942.18915476  659.42040571  394.51737455  211.47651996\n","  919.0393264   522.7833813  1014.77225605  865.72272343 1008.83342152\n"," 1077.21021158 1381.85013218 1710.72847282 1518.81340267 1303.55186765\n"," 1969.59802813 1673.51813066 2001.13909641 1968.35973886 2268.53169588\n"," 2819.66587432 2859.86720898 3173.51159398 3104.18141341 3103.32610854\n"," 3756.65703015 3933.23111957 4400.35066235 4679.22639949 4853.02420421\n"," 5269.9568146 ]\n"]}],"source":["# Your code here\n","\n","import numpy as np \n","\n","N0 = 100 \n","r = 0.4 \n","t = np.arange(start=0, stop=10.2, step=0.2)\n","\n","population_size = N0 * np.exp(r*t)\n","\n","noise = np.random.normal(loc=0, scale=250, size=np.shape(population_size))\n","\n","population_size_noise = population_size + noise \n","\n","print('Population size: ', '\\n', population_size)\n","print('Noise: ', '\\n', noise)\n","print('Population size with noise: ', '\\n', population_size_noise)\n","\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["<details>\n","  <summary>Answer</summary>\n","\n","  ```python\n","  import numpy as np\n","\n","  #set initial population\n","  N0 = 100\n","  #set growth rate\n","  rate = 0.4\n","  #create array of time points \n","  t = np.arange(start=0, stop=10.2, step=0.2)\n","\n","  #calculate population of colony at the time points in t\n","  population_size = N0 * np.exp(rate*t)\n","  print('Population size is: ',population_size)\n","\n","  #add noise to population at each time point\n","  population_size_noise = N0 * np.exp(rate*t) + np.random.normal(loc=0, scale=250, size=np.shape(population_size))\n","  print('Population size with noise is: ',population_size_noise)\n","  ```\n","</details>"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"QmxvYhS3OCNJ"},"source":["### 2.
